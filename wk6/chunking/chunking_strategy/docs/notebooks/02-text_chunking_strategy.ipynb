    "# **Text Chunking Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Document splitting or Text chunking is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning and NLP tasks. It involves breaking down large text documents into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks) for downstream tasks."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## **Why split documents?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensuring Consistent Processing:** Documents in real-world datasets rarely follow a uniform length. Some may be a few sentences long, while others span multiple pages. Splitting them into manageable chunks ensures that all documents are processed consistently, regardless of their original size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Within Model Constraints:** Most language models and embedding models have a limit on the number of tokens they can process at once. If a document exceeds this limit, it needs to be truncated or split. Chunking prevents information loss by allowing long documents to be processed in full, section by section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Improving Representation and Understanding:** When dealing with long texts, embeddings and model representations may become diluted, struggling to capture key details effectively. By breaking a document into smaller segments, each part can retain a clearer and more focused representation, leading to better downstream performance in tasks like retrieval and summarization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhancing Search and Retrieval Accuracy:** In search systems, retrieving an entire document in response to a query isn’t always helpful. Instead, chunking allows for more precise matching, so that users get results at a finer granularity—directly pointing them to the most relevant passage rather than the whole document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizing Memory and Computation:** Processing large texts as a whole can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Splitting them into smaller chunks enables better parallelization, reduces memory overhead, and speeds up processing, making it more efficient for both training and inference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking is essential for maintaining both accuracy and efficiency when working with textual data. It not only ensures smooth processing but also enhances the quality of results in applications like search engines, chatbots, and summarization systems.  \n"

    "\n",
    "Discontent with colonial rule began shortly after the defeat of France in the French and Indian War in 1763. Although the colonies had fought and supported the war, Parliament imposed new taxes to compensate for wartime costs and turned control of the colonies' western lands over to the British officials in Montreal. Representatives from several colonies convened the Stamp Act Congress; its \"Declaration of Rights and Grievances\" argued that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen. In 1767, tensions flared again following the British Parliament's passage of the Townshend Acts. In an effort to quell the mounting rebellion, King George III deployed troops to Boston. A local confrontation resulted in the troops killing protesters in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. In 1772, anti-tax demonstrators in Rhode Island destroyed the Royal Navy customs schooner Gaspee. On December 16, 1773, activists disguised as Indians instigated the Boston Tea Party and dumped chests of tea owned by the British East India Company into Boston Harbor.

On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress responded by authorizing formation of the Continental Army and appointing George Washington as its commander-in-chief. In August, the king proclaimed Massachusetts to be in a state of open defiance and rebellion. The Continental Army surrounded Boston, and the British withdrew by sea in March 1776, leaving the Patriots in control in every colony. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress began to take on the role of governing a new nation. It passed the Lee Resolution for national independence on July 2, and on July 4, 1776, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which embodied the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism, rejected monarchy and aristocracy, and famously proclaimed that \"all men are created equal\".\n",

The defeat led to the collapse of King George's control of Parliament, with a majority now in favor of ending the war on American terms. On September 3, 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris, granting the United States nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes.

    "### What is Metadata?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata** is extra information attached to each text chunk that describes details about that chunk — such as where it came from, what document or section it belongs to, or any other useful context.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the output above, `metadata = {}` is empty, meaning no extra information is stored with the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is `metadata = {}` Empty in our Output?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason:\n",
    "We did not provide any metadata while creating or splitting the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you pass only plain text (like a list of strings) to the splitter, and do **not** specify the `metadatas` argument, LangChain (and similar libraries) will create chunks with **empty metadata by default**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The splitter does **not** \"guess\" or auto-fill metadata unless:\n",
    "  - You use a loader that includes metadata, **or**\n",
    "  - You explicitly provide it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Metadata Useful? (Use Cases)\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Source Tracking**  \n",
    "Metadata can record the original file name, page number, or section — so you always know where each chunk of text came from.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Efficient Search & Retrieval**  \n",
    "When searching for information, metadata helps you filter results (e.g., only show answers from a specific chapter or document).\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Context Preservation**  \n",
    "Metadata can store topics, headings, or tags — helping you understand the context of each chunk during analysis or when displaying results.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. **Debugging & Quality Control**  \n",
    "If something goes wrong or results are poor, metadata helps you trace back to the original source and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Legal & Compliance**  \n",
    "For sensitive or regulated data, metadata can track document versions, access permissions, or retention periods.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. **Personalization & Analytics**  \n",
    "Metadata can include user IDs, timestamps, or categories — enabling personalized recommendations or usage analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When is Metadata Populated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata gets populated (filled in) at different stages, depending on how you process your documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **When Loading Documents**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a document loader (like for PDFs, Word files, or web pages), many loaders automatically add metadata such as file name, page number, or URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **When Creating Chunks**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you split plain text, you can manually provide metadata for each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **During Post-Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add or update metadata after splitting — for example by adding chunk numbers, timestamps, or tags.\n"

In the northwest, Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kings ruled portions of Punjab and Gandhāra, blending Greek and Indian cultures. The Kushan Empire (c.30-375 CE) in Gandhāra and northern India (founded by the Yüeh-Chih nomads) dominated trade on the Silk Road and patronized Buddhism. In South India, the Śatavāhanas (c.1st century BCE-3rd CE) ruled central India, supporting trade and Buddhism. These centuries saw flourishing trade (including with Rome), growth of city\\n1\\nfairs and ports, and the spread of Mahāyāna Buddhism. Scholastic Sanskrit culture also matured: Hindu epics and scriptures (Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa, Purāṇas) were consolidated, and classical literature (Kalidāsa, Kālidāsa's dramas) appeared by the Gupta era.\"\n",
