# Text Embeddings for Clustering and Classification  


Text embeddings are a powerful way to represent textual data in a numerical format, preserving semantic relationships between words, phrases, and documents. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how embeddings facilitate text classification and clustering by transforming unstructured text into structured vector representations.  

## Objectives  

1. **Load Preprocessed Text Chunks** – Retrieve previously chunked text documents.  
2. **Generate Text Embeddings** – Convert text into high-dimensional numerical representations using a sentence embedding model.  
3. **Reduce Dimensionality** – Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize embeddings in a lower-dimensional space.  
4. **Cluster and Analyze** – Use clustering techniques to group similar text chunks based on their embeddings.  


By the end of this lab, we will gain insights into how embeddings help uncover patterns in text data and improve classification and clustering tasks.
