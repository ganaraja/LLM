{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The borzois not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hunt, moving slowly, shouted “Stop!” calling in the hounds."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The borzoi whips, with a cry of “A-tu!”, galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Ilágin, Nicholas, Natásha, and “Uncle” flew recklessly, seeing only the borzois and the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Ilágin, Nicholas, Natásha, and “Uncle” feared only to lose sight of the chase."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare they had started was strong and swift."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "When the hare jumped up, he did not run at once."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare chose his direction and realized his danger."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare laid back his ears and rushed off headlong."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare had been lying in the stubble."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "In front of the hare was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted the hare were nearest."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The two borzois of the huntsman were the first to see and pursue the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Ilágin’s red-spotted Erzá passed the two borzois, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and rolled over like a ball."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare arched his back and bounded off more swiftly."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "From behind Erzá rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted Mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Nicholas shouted “Miláshka, dear!” in triumph."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Mílka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and flew past."}

{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The beautiful Erzá reached the hare again."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Erzá paused near the hare’s scut measuring distance to avoid mistake and seize his hind leg."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Ilágin wailed “Erzá, darling!” in a voice unlike his own."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Erzá did not hearken to Ilágin's appeal."}

{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running like a pair of carriage horses."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Erzá and Mílka began to overtake the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The hare could run on the balk more easily than the borzois could overtake him."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "A third voice shouted “Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, come on!”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle’s red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up with the two foremost borzois."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The red borzoi pushed ahead of them regardless of strain, put on speed close to the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The red borzoi knocked the hare off the balk onto the rye field."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The red borzoi again put on speed more viciously, sinking to his knees in the muddy field."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The red borzoi rolled over with the hare, muddying his back."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "A ring of borzois surrounded the hare."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Everyone drew up round the crowd of dogs."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "The delighted “Uncle” dismounted and cut off a pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle glanced round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle spoke without knowing whom to or what about."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle said “That’s it, come on! That’s a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That’s it, come on!”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle was panting and looking wrathfully around as if abusing someone."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle was as if the borzois were his enemies and had insulted him."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle had at last succeeded in justifying himself."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle said “There are your thousand-ruble ones.... That’s it, come on!...”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle said “Rugáy, here’s a pad for you!”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Uncle said “You’ve deserved it, that’s it, come on!”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Nicholas said “She’d tired herself out, she’d run it down three times by herself.”."}
{"chunk_id": 338, "factoid": "Ilágin’s groom asked “But what is there in running across it like that?”."}
