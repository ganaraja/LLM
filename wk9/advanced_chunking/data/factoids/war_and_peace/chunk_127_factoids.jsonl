{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Now then, Matvévna, dear old lady, don’t let me down! Túshin said while moving from the gun."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "A strange, unfamiliar voice called \"Captain Túshin! Captain!\" from above Túshin’s head."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin turned round in dismay."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The staff officer had turned Túshin out of the booth at Grunth."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The staff officer shouted \"Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...\" in a gasping voice."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin thought \"Why are they down on me?\" while looking in alarm at his superior."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin muttered \"I... don’t...\" while holding up two fingers to his cap."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "A cannon ball flying close to Túshin caused him to duck and bend over his horse."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin paused, and before he could say something more, another cannon ball stopped him."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin turned his horse and galloped off."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin shouted \"Retire! All to retire!\" from a distance."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The soldiers laughed."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "An adjutant arrived later with the same order."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The adjutant was Prince Andrew."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew saw an unharnessed horse with a broken leg lying screaming beside the harnessed horses when he rode up to the space where Túshin’s guns were stationed."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Blood gushed from the horse’s leg as from a spring."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Several dead men lay among the limbers."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "As Prince Andrew approached, one cannon ball after another passed over him and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The mere thought of being afraid roused Prince Andrew again."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew thought \"I cannot be afraid\" and dismounted slowly among the guns."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew delivered the order and did not leave the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Together with Túshin, Prince Andrew stepped across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French to attend to the removal of the guns."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "An artilleryman told Prince Andrew that a staff officer had been here a minute ago but had skipped off."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The artilleryman said \"Not like your honor!\""}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said nothing to Túshin."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew and Túshin were both so busy that they seemed not to notice one another."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four were limbered up."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The two uninjured cannon began moving down the hill."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "One shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew rode up to Túshin."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said \"Well, till we meet again...\" while holding out his hand to Túshin."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin said \"Good-by, my dear fellow.\""}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin said \"Dear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!\" and tears suddenly filled his eyes."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke hung low over the field of battle on the horizon."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "It was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was more conspicuous."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded more often and nearer."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "As Túshin with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some staff, including the staff officer and Zherkóv, who had been twice sent to Túshin’s battery but had never reached it."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "They interrupted one another, gave, and transmitted orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching Túshin."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin gave no orders and rode behind on his artillery nag, fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The jaunty infantry officer who had rushed out of Túshin’s wattle shed just before the battle was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on \"Matvévna’s\" carriage."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked for a seat."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The hussar cadet said \"Captain, for God’s sake! I’ve hurt my arm\" timidly."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The hussar cadet said \"For God’s sake... I can’t walk. For God’s sake!\""}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and had been refused."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The cadet asked in a hesitating, piteous voice."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "The cadet said \"Tell them to give me a seat, for God’s sake!\""}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin said \"Give him a seat.\""}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin said \"Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,\" addressing his favorite soldier."}
{"chunk_id": 127, "factoid": "Túshin asked \"And where is the wounded officer?\""}
