{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre raised his hand to the kerchief as if wishing to take it off."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre let the kerchief drop again."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Five minutes spent with Pierre's eyes bandaged seemed to Pierre an hour."}

{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The newcomer turned in Pierre's direction at a slight rustle made by Pierre."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The newcomer asked, 'Why have you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come here?'"}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The newcomer asked, 'What do you seek from us?'"}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The newcomer asked, 'Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?'"}

{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre moved toward the Rhetor with bated breath and a beating heart."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The Rhetor is the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre recognized in the Rhetor a man named Smolyaninov whom Pierre knew."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre was mortified to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre wished the newcomer simply a brother and a virtuous instructor."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "The Rhetor had to repeat the Rhetor's question because Pierre could not utter a word for a long time."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre uttered, 'Yes… I… I… desire regeneration,' with difficulty."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Smolyaninov said, 'Very well.'"}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Smolyaninov said, 'Have you any idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?' quietly and quickly."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre said, 'I… hope… for guidance… help… in regeneration,' with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre was excited and unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Smolyaninov asked, 'What is your conception of Freemasonry?'"}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre answered, 'I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims,' feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of Pierre's words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Pierre answered, 'I imagine…'"}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Smolyaninov said, 'Good!' quickly, apparently satisfied with Pierre's answer."}
{"chunk_id": 236, "factoid": "Smolyaninov asked, 'Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?'"}
