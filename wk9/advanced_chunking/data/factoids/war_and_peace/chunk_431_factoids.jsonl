{"chunk_id": 431, "factoid": "Sugar was more plentiful than anything else."}
{"chunk_id": 431, "factoid": "It was decided that Mary Hendríkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn because it took too long to dissolve."}
{"chunk_id": 431, "factoid": "Rostóv received his tumbler, added some rum to it, and asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir it."}
{"chunk_id": 431, "factoid": "Mary Hendríkhovna said \"But you take it without sugar?\"."}
