{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "At dusk, Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "While approaching the house, Prince Andrew smiled and drew Pierre’s attention to a commotion at the back porch."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "A woman bent with age, carrying a wallet on her back, and a short long‑haired young man in a black garment rushed back to the gate when they saw the carriage driving up."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Two women ran out after them, and all four looked round at the carriage before running in dismay up the steps of the back porch."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said that those people were Mary’s \"God’s folk\"."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said that the pilgrims had mistaken them for his father and that Mary disobeys him by receiving the pilgrims even though he orders them to be driven away."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Pierre asked what \"God's folk\" were."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew had no time to answer; servants came out to meet them; he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "The old prince had gone to town and was expected back any minute."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father’s house; Prince Andrew himself went to the nursery."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew told Pierre that they should go and see his sister when he returned."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said he had not found his sister yet, that she was hiding now, sitting with her \"God's folk\"; he said it would serve her right, she would be confused, but Pierre would see her \"God's folk\"; he said it was very curious."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Pierre asked again what \"God's folk\" were."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew told Pierre to come and see for himself."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary was disconcerted and red patches appeared on her face when they went in."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "In Princess Mary’s snug room, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk’s cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Near them, in an armchair, sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on her childlike face."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary said to Andrew, \"why didn’t you warn me?\" with mild reproach, standing before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary said to Pierre, \"Charmée de vous voir. Je suis très contente de vous voir,\" as he kissed her hand."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary had known Pierre as a child."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary’s favorable disposition toward Pierre was due to his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and his kindly simple face."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary looked at Pierre with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, \"I like you very much, but please don’t laugh at my people.\""}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "After exchanging greetings, Princess Mary and Pierre sat down."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said, \"Ah, and Ivánushka is here too!\" while glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary said \"Andrew!\" imploringly."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew told Pierre, \"Il faut que vous sachiez que c’est une femme.\""}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Princess Mary repeated, \"Andrew, au nom de Dieu!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "It was evident that Prince Andrew’s ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary’s helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long‑established relations on the matter."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said, \"Mais, ma bonne amie, vous devriez au contraire m’être reconnaissante de ce que j’explique à Pierre votre intimité avec ce jeune homme.\""}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Pierre said \"Really?\" while gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness into Ivánushka’s face."}
{"chunk_id": 259, "factoid": "Ivánushka looked round at them all with crafty eyes when she saw that she was being spoken about."}
