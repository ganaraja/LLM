{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The regimental commander found the words of the order unclear."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "It was questioned whether the troops should be in marching order."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The battalion commanders decided to present the regiment in parade order."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The principle used in the decision was that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low enough."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "After a twenty-mile march, the soldiers were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "By morning the regiment presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Each of the two thousand men knew his place and his duty."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Each of the two thousand men had every button and every strap in place."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Each of the two thousand men shone with cleanliness."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The commander in chief would have found on every man a clean shirt."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Each man's knapsack contained the appointed number of articles: awl, soap, and all."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The soldiers said that."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The state of the soldiers’ boots was a circumstance that concerned everyone."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "More than half of the men's boots had holes."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The defect in the boots was not due to any fault of the regimental commander."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Despite repeated demands, the Austrian commissariat had not issued boots."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The regiment had marched approximately seven hundred miles."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and was wider from chest to back than across the shoulders."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He wore a brand-new uniform with creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes that seemed to stand rather than lie on his massive shoulders."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He walked in front of the line, and at every step he pulled himself up, slightly arching his back."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and his whole mind was engrossed by it."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "His strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied a significant part of his thoughts."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He said, \"Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?\" addressing one of the battalion commanders, who smiled and pressed forward."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He said, \"We had our hands full last night. However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?\""}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He said, \"It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin Meadow.\""}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The commander asked, \"What?\""}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "At that moment, on the road from the town where signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horseback."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The two men were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order, which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment in the state it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, packs, and without any preparation."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Kutúzov, not considering this junction advisable, intended to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He intended to meet the regiment with this object; the worse the condition of the regiment, the better pleased the commander in chief would be."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "On hearing this, the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture."}
{"chunk_id": 72, "factoid": "He remarked, \"A fine mess we’ve made of it!\""}
