{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv had lately procured a large, fine, mettlesome Donéts horse."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The horse was dun-colored with a light mane and tail."}

{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Riding the horse was a pleasure to Rostóv."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor's wife."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv did not think of the impending danger."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Formerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Now Rostóv had not the least feeling of fear."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv was fearless."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv was not fearless because he had grown used to being under fire."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv was not fearless because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv had grown accustomed to think about anything but the impending danger when going into action."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "During the first period of his service, Rostóv had not been able to think about anything but the impending danger."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "With time, Rostóv learned to think about anything but the impending danger."}

{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv had a calm and careless air as though he were merely out for a ride."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyín."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Ilyín talked much and in great agitation."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Rostóv knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering."}

{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds, the wind fell."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Drops continued to fall but vertically now."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "All was still."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The whole sun appeared on the horizon."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The sun disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "A few minutes later the sun reappeared brighter from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its edge."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Everything grew bright and glittered."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The sound of guns came ahead of them with that light and as if in reply to it."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Before Rostóv had time to consider and determine the distance of the firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from Vítebsk."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The adjutant had orders to advance at a trot along the road."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The squadron overtook the infantry and the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The battery had quickened its pace."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The squadron rode down a hill."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The squadron passed through an empty and deserted village and then ascended again."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The horses began to lather."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The men began to flush."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The order of the regimental commander was heard ahead: “Halt! Dress your ranks!”."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The order from in front was: “Forward by the left. Walk, march!”."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The hussars passed along the line of troops on the left flank of our position."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The hussars halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Our infantry stood to the right in a dense column."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Our infantry were the reserve."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Higher up the hill on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Our guns were brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "In front beyond a hollow dale, the enemy’s columns and guns could be seen."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Our advanced line was already in action."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Our advanced line could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "At these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv’s spirits rose."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The sounds were like the strains of the merriest music."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The shots cracked: trap-ta-ta-tap!"}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The shots cracked together and then several quickly one after another."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "All was silent again."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "It sounded again as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "A cannonade began."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Count Ostermann halted."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Count Ostermann spoke to the commander of the regiment."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "Count Ostermann rode up the hill to the guns."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The command was: “Form column! Prepare to charge!”."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The infantry in front of the Uhlans departed into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The Uhlans started."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The streamers on the Uhlans’ spears fluttered."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The Uhlans trotted downhill toward the French cavalry seen below to the left."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "As the hussars took the places vacated by the Uhlans, bullets came from the front."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The bullets were whining and whistling."}
{"chunk_id": 433, "factoid": "The bullets fell spent without taking effect."}
