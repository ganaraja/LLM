{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre had begun to think of the last station."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre was still pondering the same question."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The question was so important that Pierre took no notice of what went on around him."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre was indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier or later."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre was indifferent as to whether he secured accommodation at this station."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "It was a matter of indifference whether Pierre remained there for a few hours or for the rest of his life."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The postmaster, Pierre's wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzhók embroidery came into the room offering their services."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre looked at them over his spectacles."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "In the solitude of the journey, the thoughts seized Pierre with special force."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre always returned to these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The thread of the chief screw which held Pierre's life together was stripped."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The postmaster began obsequiously to beg Pierre to wait only two hours."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The postmaster would let Pierre have the courier horses when, come what might."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "It was plain that the postmaster was lying and only wanted to get more money from the traveler."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre asked himself whether this was good or bad."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre said it is good for Pierre, bad for another traveler, and unavoidable for Pierre because Pierre needs money for food."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "There was no answer to any of these questions, except one."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The answer was: “You’ll die and all will end. You’ll die and know all, or cease asking.”"}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Dying was also dreadful."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The Torzhók peddler woman stood in her tattered cloak looking timidly at Pierre."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The Torzhók peddler woman wanted the money."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre thought that money could not add a hair’s breadth to happiness or peace of mind."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre thought that nothing in the world could make the Torzhók peddler woman or Pierre less a prey to evil and death."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Death ends all and must come today or tomorrow, at any rate, in an instant compared with eternity."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre said nothing has been found out, nothing discovered."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre said all we can know is that we know nothing."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Pierre said that is the height of human wisdom."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Everything within and around Pierre seemed confused, senseless, and repellent."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction."}

{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The postmaster entered the room followed by another traveler, also detained for lack of horses."}
{"chunk_id": 230, "factoid": "The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man."}
