{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier answered, \"What else do you expect?\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"She has no mercy, you know!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards.\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"One can’t help being afraid.\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier laughed."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Several men with bright kindly faces stopped beside Pierre."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The men seemed not to have expected Pierre to talk like anybody else."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The discovery that Pierre talked like anybody else delighted the men."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"It’s the business of us soldiers.\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"But in a gentleman it’s wonderful!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The soldier said, \"There’s a gentleman for you!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The young officer cried, \"To your places!\" to the men gathered round Pierre."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The young officer was exercising his duties for the first or second time."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The young officer treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The booming cannonade and fusillade were especially intense to the left where Bagratión’s flèches were."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The smoke of the firing made it almost impossible for Pierre to distinguish anything."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre’s whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle formed by the men in the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre’s first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was replaced by another feeling."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre had seen a soldier lying alone in the hayfield."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre, seated on the slope of the trench, observed the faces of those around him."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "By ten o’clock about twenty men had already been carried away from the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Two guns were smashed."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Spent bullets buzzed and whistled around the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The men in the battery seemed not to notice the damage."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "A man shouted, \"A live one!\" as a whistling shell approached."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Another man added, \"Not this way! To the infantry!\" with loud laughter, seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Another remarked, \"Are you bowing to a friend, eh?\" chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see what was happening in front."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Those soldiers said, \"They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,\" pointing over the earthwork."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "An old sergeant shouted, \"Mind your own business\" at them."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The old sergeant said, \"If they’ve retired it’s because there’s work for them to do farther back.\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The sergeant took one of the men by the shoulders and gave him a shove with his knee."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "A burst of laughter followed the sergeant’s shove."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Shouts from one side said, \"To the fifth gun, wheel it up!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The merry voices of those moving the gun rose with, \"Now then, all together, like bargees!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The red-faced humorist cried, \"Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!\" showing his teeth chaffing Pierre."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "The red-faced humorist added reproachfully, \"Awkward baggage!\" to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man's leg."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Another said, \"Now then, you foxes!\" laughing at some militiamen who stooped low and entered the battery to carry away the wounded man."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Those people shouted, \"So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You’re scared!\" at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "They mimicked the peasants saying, \"There, lads... oh, oh! They don’t like it at all!\""}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after every loss, the liveliness increased more and more."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "As flames of hidden fire came more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, the lightning of hidden fire grew more and more intense and glowed in the faces of these men."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre did not look out at the battlefield."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre was not concerned to know what was happening at the battlefield."}
{"chunk_id": 530, "factoid": "Pierre was entirely absorbed in watching the fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul."}
