{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and guests settled down in their places."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The strains of the count’s household band were replaced by clatter of knives and forks, voices of visitors, and soft steps of footmen."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "At one end of the table the countess sat with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left; other lady visitors were farther down."}

{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "On the other side of the long table children, tutors, and governesses sat."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and at her tall cap with light‑blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses without neglecting his own."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The countess, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "At the ladies’ end of the table an even chatter of voices was heard all the time; at the men’s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The colonel of hussars grew more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Berg, with tender smiles, told Véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Borís told his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanged glances with Natásha, who was sitting opposite."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Pierre chose from the two soups turtle with savory patties and ate all dishes and wines."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: 'Dry Madeira', 'Hungarian', or 'Rhine wine' as the case might be."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever‑increasing amiability at the other guests."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Natásha, who sat opposite, looked at Borís as girls of thirteen look at a boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Sónya wore a company smile but was tormented by jealousy; she turned pale, blushed, and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The German tutor tried to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The German tutor felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The German tutor frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that he wanted it not to quench his thirst or from greediness but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "The colonel told the guests that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief."}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Shinshín remarked, 'And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?'"}
{"chunk_id": 40, "factoid": "Shinshín remarked, 'He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.'"}
