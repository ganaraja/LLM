{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "At forty paces distance nothing could be seen."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "For three minutes Dólokhov and Pierre had been ready, but Dólokhov and Pierre still delayed and all were silent."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov said 'Well, begin!'"}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre said 'All right.'"}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "A feeling of dread was in the air."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of men’s will."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Denísov first went to the barrier and announced that Dólokhov and Pierre should proceed and take their pistols."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Denísov shouted 'O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!'."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov and Pierre advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to one another."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov and Pierre began to see one another through the mist."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov and Pierre had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier."}

{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre said 'So I can fire when I like!'."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "At the word 'three,' Pierre went quickly forward."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre missed the trodden path and stepped into the deep snow."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre held the pistol in his right hand at arm’s length."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre was apparently afraid of shooting himself with the pistol."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre held his left hand carefully back."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre wanted to support his right hand with his left hand."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre knew he must not do so."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre looked down at his feet."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre glanced at Dólokhov."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre bent his finger as he had been shown."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre fired."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre did not expect a loud report."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre shuddered at the sound."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre smiled at his own sensations."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre stood still."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "The smoke was rendered denser by the mist."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "The smoke prevented Pierre from seeing anything for an instant."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "There was no second report as Pierre had expected."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Pierre only heard Dólokhov’s hurried steps."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov’s figure came in view through the smoke."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov was pressing one hand to his left side."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov's other hand clutched his drooping pistol."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Dólokhov’s face was pale."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Rostóv ran toward Dólokhov."}
{"chunk_id": 209, "factoid": "Rostóv said something."}
