The text presents a comprehensive, tightly sequenced condensation of George Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss from its evocative opening image of the River Floss and Dorlcote Mill through the Tulliver family’s rise, collapse, and partial restoration, culminating in Maggie Tulliver’s final trial, renunciation, and death, while also summarizing key terms of the Project Gutenberg License and organizational context. It begins with the narrator’s backward glance at the Floss and St Ogg’s, then moves into the Tulliver parlour, where Mr. Tulliver debates his son Tom’s education with Mrs. Tulliver. A proud miller obsessed with water-rights and wary of lawyers, Mr. Tulliver wants Tom to have a “good eddication” that will make him a practical, capable man able to stand up to legal “cunning.” Mrs. Tulliver, a Dodson by birth, thinks in homely metrics—linen, preserves, puddings—and worries about feeding and sending treats to a boy boarded within carrier’s-cart distance. Mr. Riley, a genteel appraiser and auctioneer familiar with earlier disputes “about the dam,” is consulted; his congenial authority, more than rigorous judgment, steers Tulliver from a general mistrust of lawyers toward the specific choice of a clergyman tutor. Riley recommends the Rev. Walter Stelling, an Oxford M.A. and son-in-law to a Mudport man of substance, as the sort of gentleman who can teach “anything” once “dropped a hint.” The narrator notes, with irony, that such small impulses often settle momentous decisions.

Against this domestic debate, the household’s character emerges. Maggie’s quick intelligence and eagerness for books charm and unsettle her father; she reads pictures from a second-hand lot that includes Defoe’s History of the Devil, drawing Riley’s mild rebuke that she should have prettier books. Mrs. Tulliver prefers the fair, tidy ideal embodied by cousin Lucy Deane and frets that Maggie’s looks are “unbecoming.” Tom, dogged and authoritative in boyish lore but slow at books, commands Maggie’s worship. Scenes by the water and in the meal-dusted mill interior reveal both Maggie’s hunger for knowledge and Luke the head miller’s skepticism of schooling that won’t feed a trade. Idyllic play cracks when Luke reports that Tom’s rabbits, neglected in a distant hutch, have died; Maggie’s guilt meets Tom’s return with presents—including a fishing-line reserved for her—and a stern withdrawal of love once he learns the rabbits are dead. Maggie resolves to starve herself in expiation but returns under the pull of being loved; the siblings reconcile in childlike warmth that briefly overrules their competing codes.

A serene morning’s fishing at the Round Pool follows; Tom’s practical mastery and Maggie’s dreaminess meet when she unexpectedly catches a tench and basks in praise. The narrator reflects that early loves and landscapes imprint themselves indelibly. At Easter a Dodson family gathering, part council on Tom’s schooling, sketches the Dodson code with comic exactitude: thrifty housewifery, savings, flawless funerals, suspicion of “strange butter,” and persistent criticism of Bessy Tulliver’s extravagance and her husband’s litigiousness. Kitchen raids, jam-puffs, and Tom’s “fair division” test display Maggie’s heedless contentment followed by quick remorse alongside Tom’s rigid sense of justice. Tom’s rough friendship with Bob Jakin—dealer in ferrets, nests, and hedgehogs—ends in a scuffle over cheating. A family climax arrives when Maggie, stung by her hair’s disobedience, shears it; Dodson outrage rains down, satirically framed through Aunt Glegg’s severity and Aunt Pullet’s funereal proprieties. Mr. Tulliver alone steadies Maggie with private tenderness. The aunts and uncles then debate Tom’s education. Mr. Tulliver refuses a grammar-school path, clings to the idea of a clergyman tutor, and defends education as capital in a business that requires none; a quarrel explodes and Mrs. Glegg storms out, widening a breach around money, pride, and decorum.

As the men discuss politics and trade, Mr. Deane’s hard-headed buoyancy contrasts with Tulliver’s apocalyptic anxieties about water-rights and lawsuits. Fearing that Mrs. Glegg will call in a £500 loan, Mr. Tulliver vows to repay at once and rides early to Basset to demand £300 from his brother-in-law Moss on a promissory note. Determined to be “hard,” he softens at the sight of his weary sister Gritty’s household and a Maggie-like little daughter, wavers on the road, and finally forgives the debt in deed if not in form, promising to “make a shift” without it and to bring Tom and Maggie to see their cousins. Meanwhile Maggie’s day at Garum Firs parades Dodson gentility: guarded mats, polished oak, a musical snuff-box, and ritualized bonnet-showing. Childish tensions sharpen—Lucy’s delicate triumphs with card houses charm Tom, Maggie ruins his structure in jealous hurt, and later, excluded from a pond jaunt to see a pike, pushes Lucy into the mud. Afterward Maggie runs away to gypsies on Dunlow Common, longing for outside sympathy and a new identity; the camp both flatters and alarms her, and she gratefully seizes an offered ride home, meeting her father by chance on the road. He rescues and soothes her; no reproaches follow.

The canvas broadens to St Ogg’s, a town of mellow brick and wary respectability, layered with memories and legends (St Ogg ferrying the Virgin and Child). The Glegg household juxtaposes Mr. Glegg’s gardening and near generosities against Mrs. Glegg’s regimented thrift. A breakfast quarrel over butter and the £500 lent to Mr. Tulliver leads to mediation by Mrs. Pullet, a temporary truce, and then a brusque letter from Mr. Tulliver promising repayment with interest within a month and refusing favors—a proud step that hardens the breach and nudges him toward loans within Wakem’s orbit.

Book Second places Tom at Mr. Stelling’s parsonage-school as the sole pupil, laboring under the Eton Grammar and Euclid. Stelling believes classical drill and geometry “plough and harrow” the mind for all crops; Tom, concrete and practical, struggles with irregular verbs and proofs. The master sees only obstinacy; Tom’s humiliation sends him briefly to prayer before he gives way under defeats. Domestic refinement overlays strained finances at the parsonage; Tom wheels little Laura and transfers resentment to the pale, careful mistress. Maggie’s visit delights him; her appetite for the Latin Grammar thrills her, while Stelling deprecates girls’ intelligence and bars her from Euclid. Their fortnight displays Maggie’s ardor and Tom’s literal courage. Christmas brings Tom home to delights darkened by escalating quarrels over Pivart’s irrigation and Wakem’s legal cunning. Back at King’s Lorton a new companion arrives: Philip Wakem, whose drawing skill and Homeric lore captivate Tom’s fighting imagination even as suspicion lingers. Mr. Poulter’s drills and sword tales intoxicate Tom; in bravado he buys the sword, gashes his foot, and hides the cause until Philip secures a reassuring prognosis. Gratitude heals the boys’ quarrel, but Mr. Tulliver warns Tom not to grow close to the lawyer’s son; warmth cools into decorum and then distance.

Tom grows toward sixteen under Stelling’s monotonous course, acquiring a neat hand and the sound of learning more than its substance. Mr. Tulliver pays and does not intervene. Then calamity comes: Maggie appears at King’s Lorton to tell Tom the lawsuit is lost; Wakem has taken the mortgage; their father fell and now lies insensible, recognizing only Maggie. The children go home, passing through “childhood’s golden gates” into wilderness. Mr. Tulliver had nursed hopes to remain “Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill,” borrow on harsh terms, and shield Bessy’s furniture; Wakem’s letter struck him down. A bailiff smokes in the parlour; Mrs. Tulliver mourns her “household gods”—linen she spun, sprigged china, the silver teapot. Tom promises to work; Maggie defends their father. A family council measures charity against decorum; Tom proposes that any legacies be brought forward now to buy in the furniture and avoid public disgrace; aunts refuse. When Mrs. Moss confesses a £300 debt, Mr. Glegg explains that bankruptcy compels repayment. Tom recalls his father’s declared wish, formed before debts swelled, never to distress Moss; Uncle Glegg reasons that destroying the note would accord with that prior intent. They search the oak chest; its heavy bang shocks Mr. Tulliver into lucid anger. He greets his sister Gritty, charges Tom to pay everybody—first Luke’s fifty pounds—and be “easy” with the Mosses about the three hundred; he blames “the law” and tells Tom to make Wakem “smart” if he can. After he relapses, Tom goes to Uncle Deane for a situation and learns that his costly classical schooling left him ignorant of bookkeeping and calculation; he must start on the wharf and learn the “smell of things.” Dismissed and chastened, he passes the bill for the sale of Dorlcote Mill. The household sale clangs below the sickroom; Bob Jakin returns with loyal help, offering nine of the ten sovereigns he has earned. Tom refuses out of pride; Maggie asks Bob to hold the money ready. Deane considers buying the Mill for Guest & Co. and retaining Tulliver as manager, but Wakem’s mortgage rules. Tom finds a warehouse berth and studies at night; Mrs. Tulliver resolves to appeal to Wakem in person, hoping civility may accomplish what her husband’s wrath has not.

Wakem greets “Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was” politely; Mr. Tulliver’s demonized image of him is punctured even as Wakem’s cool superiority shapes his plan. Mrs. Tulliver pleads that he refrain from buying the Mill, citing Mr. Glegg’s and Mr. Deane’s readiness to purchase and employ her husband; at minimum, she begs that her husband not be forced to serve under him. The interview alters Wakem’s intentions. Without hatred, but with the relish of “magnanimous cruelty,” he sees profit, local preeminence, and the chance to mortify Tulliver by offering a manager’s post that compels subjection while wearing a benevolent mask. He summons the auctioneer and moves swiftly.

When Mr. Tulliver first comes downstairs on a bright January day, illness has erased time: he believes remedies are still possible. The family dreads his awakening because Wakem now owns the Mill and land and has already offered employment through intermediaries. Aunts and uncles insist the offer cannot be refused; bread trumps pride. Tom recoils but feels powerless; Maggie keeps her mother’s chatter away. Luke’s well-meaning truth that the master “would have paid if he could” drives Tulliver to the word “bankrupt,” forcing revelation: home and birthright are gone. He insists on seeing the stripped parlour; the lone chair and bureau mark the erasure of station. He calls for the family Bible and lingers over entries—his mother Margaret Beaton, his marriage to Elizabeth Dodson—before fear over the Moss loan and remorse toward his wife return. In painful calculation he recognizes his unfitness for new trades, resents Dodson charity, and feels bound to the place—orchard, yard, river—of his boyhood. He finally vows to keep his word to Bessy and take service under John Wakem, whom he will never forgive, and compels Tom to write this hatred into the family Bible, binding son to father’s revenge.

Reduced life follows. Tom hardens into the single aim of repayment; Mrs. Tulliver, bereft of small pleasures, clings to maternal tasks; Mr. Tulliver grows mute and sullen, hugging the tin box of hoarded quarters. Maggie’s ardent mind starves for guidance, then discovers Thomas à Kempis among secondhand books that Bob Jakin brings alongside the Christian Year, Rasselas, and Beauties of the Spectator. À Kempis’s voice of renunciation excites her: she embraces ascetic self-denial, publicly seeks sewing work (drawing Tom’s reproof), bathes daily tasks in pious meaning, and carries pride into self-abasement. Her father sorrowfully fears she will be “thrown away.”

Book Fifth reintroduces Philip Wakem at the Mill; Maggie avoids the fathers and later meets Philip in the Red Deeps, a once-terrifying wood now a sanctuary. Their reunion lifts Maggie’s heart; conscience troubles her over secrecy. Philip pleads for brief, honest meetings as a harmless balm; Maggie’s renunciatory ethic resists, then accepts the “chance meeting” fiction. She refuses Scott’s The Pirate as too inflaming. In parallel Tom proves shrewd at Guest & Co., sending most of his rising salary home to the tin box and, through Bob Jakin, opens an exporting venture financed by cautious Gleggs—unknown to his father. By Maggie and Philip’s second meeting their debate deepens: he condemns self-stupefaction; she praises resignation; finally she concedes “no concealment” that is nonetheless secret to everyone else. Nearly a year on, their talk over Corinne touches rivalry and beauty; she insists Lucy’s goodness eclipses vanity. Philip’s love ripens to confession; Maggie admits she loves him but vows secrecy and filial obedience. The clandestine bond lasts a year until Aunt Pullet glimpses them twice; Tom intercepts Maggie, forces her to swear on the family Bible to renounce private meetings, and denounces Philip in the Red Deeps. Philip promises to seek only Maggie’s good; concealment ends. Three weeks later Tom astonishes his parents with £320 in the bank—profits from his trading and a Mr. Glegg loan; added to the tin box, it promises full repayment. At the creditors’ dinner Mr. Tulliver, flushed with relief, rides home, meets Wakem, quarrels, and in frenzy whips him; Maggie’s cry stops him; he falls ill and soon dies, blessing the siblings and groaning that if God forgives “raskills,” He may forgive him.

Book Sixth shifts to Mr. Deane’s drawing-room where Lucy and Stephen Guest flirt amid music. Stephen anticipates another admirer for Maggie; Lucy praises Tom’s principles and mentions his boldness during a bank stoppage. Stephen carries a note to Philip. When Maggie visits, Stephen is unexpectedly stirred by her beauty and earnest gaze. A river outing and Purcell’s songs intensify a mutual, dangerous attraction. Maggie resolves to ask Tom to lift her vow to Philip but cannot break with her brother. Tom, now at Bob Jakin’s riverside house, seeks a path to reclaim the Mill; Mr. Deane and Mr. Guest will consider a purchase if Wakem will sell. Lucy, showing quiet shrewdness, learns Wakem’s property is unprofitable and tells Philip, who confronts his father with Maggie’s portraits, confesses clandestine meetings, asks leave to marry, and challenges rancor toward an innocent girl. Wakem promises to sell for improvements’ value but refuses to deal with Tom. Society admires Maggie as a beautiful curiosity; at the charity bazaar Wakem buys from her kindly; Stephen notices Philip watching with longing. Dr. Kenn observes Maggie’s fatigue and kindness. Maggie tells Lucy her “best and highest lot” would be to marry Philip, but she cannot divide herself from Tom. At Park House, lights and flowers surround a dance; she shines, then in the conservatory Stephen, seized by a sudden passion, kisses her arm and clasps her wrist; she rebukes him and believes the moment has cured her susceptibility.

Stephen cannot rest; he pleads for a walk, begs forgiveness, and argues that true love justifies breaking bonds, while Maggie insists that the “clue of life” is pity and faithfulness to reliance placed in them. Each vows resistance. A planned boating party tests them: Philip sends word he is ill and asks Stephen to take his place alongside Maggie and Lucy. The tide draws Stephen and Maggie beyond Luckreth; he proposes not to return until they are married. She protests the unmanliness of depriving her of choice; he argues that public judgment would be the same if they had married the day before. At Mudport, after a night under a Dutch vessel’s stars, Maggie’s inward law prevails: she declares that no future can be founded by ratifying wrong to Lucy and Philip; she will confess all and cling to the divine voice within. Stephen claims a man’s love is different, more miserable in denial; she insists one cannot choose happiness by indulging the present but must choose obedience to an inward law. She leaves him and returns alone.

Back at Dorlcote Mill—now Tom’s again—Bob Jakin has reported that Maggie landed at Mudport with Stephen. Tom, expecting disgrace, rejects Maggie at the gate as one who has deceived Lucy and used Philip as a screen. She begs to be guided, to make amends; he refuses her under his roof. Their mother resolves to go with her. Bob installs them with delicate silence and names his baby after Maggie. Gossip hardens; society condemns her as unwomanly and a traitor to Lucy, while noting that acceptance would have been easy had she returned as Mrs. Stephen Guest. Dr. Kenn, in mourning, receives Maggie with grave compassion, hears her story, and argues that the Church must welcome penitents even if St Ogg’s fails in fellowship. He warns unjust constructions will persist and offers to help her leave to work elsewhere; she insists on staying to atone. He tries to find her work; refusals mount; he finally employs her as daily governess to his children. Rumours now impugn his motives and dishonor his late wife’s memory; the Miss Guests fear Stephen might marry Maggie and hope to restore him to Lucy. Aunt Glegg, stern but fair, uses Stephen’s letter to defend Maggie publicly and offers her a home if she will come humbly; Maggie declines dependence, preferring to earn her bread.

Philip writes a long, unpostmarked letter blending forgiveness and self-knowledge. He confesses jealousy and despair, insists he never doubted her truth, rejects suicide, and transforms self-rebellion into willing endurance; he claims no right beyond remembrance and promises to remain near and ready to serve. Maggie, overwhelmed, prays to be kept from choosing joy that inflicts pain on others. When Stephen writes from Holland, secretly in Mudport, pleading for a single word—“Come!”—she burns his letter after a long inner battle, recalling “I have received the Cross… I will bear it till death,” and resolves to write a final renunciation next day.

That night the flood comes. Water runs under the door; a boat smashes against the house; Maggie seizes an oar, rows into the torrent, and is swept over submerged fields. Orienting herself by trees and the dark line of St Ogg’s, she battles current and wreckage toward the Mill, where chestnuts stand deep in water and part of the structure has fallen into the Ripple. She calls to Tom, who climbs down from the attic into her boat. Confronted with her peril and devotion, his rigidity melts: “Magsie!” They set out to seek Lucy first; a rafted mass of wreckage sweeps down; another boat shouts a warning; Tom clasps his sister; their boat disappears. Found later “in their death they were not divided,” they are buried together near their father. Years pass; fields ripen; the Mill is rebuilt; two men visit at different times, each carrying his keenest joy and sorrow there—one later with a “sweet face,” the other alone among the Red Deeps—while St Ogg’s goes on under familiar suns with irreparable loss.

The text closes with a précis of key provisions from the Project Gutenberg License and organizational information tied to the distribution of electronic texts. It distinguishes between the public-domain status of underlying works in the United States and the specific obligations that arise when the “Project Gutenberg” name is used. If an electronic work bears the Project Gutenberg designation or uses the Project Gutenberg trademark, distributors must comply with Sections 1.E.1–1.E.7 or obtain permission under 1.E.8 or 1.E.9. Works posted with a copyright holder’s permission (1.E.3) carry additional terms specified by that holder alongside the standard paragraphs. Section 1.E.4 requires that the complete license remain attached to any copy or file containing the work. Section 1.E.5 forbids distributing any part without prominently displaying the exact Project Gutenberg attribution sentence from 1.E.1 and providing ready access to the full license. Section 1.E.6 allows alternate formats (binary, compressed, marked-up, proprietary) so long as distributors also provide, at no extra cost, a copy in the original or official format or a means to export such a copy, and include the full license. Section 1.E.7 prohibits charging fees for access or use unless a distributor complies with 1.E.8 or 1.E.9. Under 1.E.8, fees are permitted if distributors pay a royalty equal to twenty percent of gross profits on uses of Project Gutenberg works (calculated using the same method used for applicable taxes) to the trademark owner for donation to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, provide a thirty-day right of refund for users who reject the license, honor a ninety-day defect-replacement or refund right (1.F.3), and comply with all other free-distribution terms. Section 1.E.9 requires written permission from the Foundation to charge fees or impose different terms.

Section 1.F explains that despite careful efforts, electronic works and their media may contain “Defects,” and, apart from the limited replacement or refund in 1.F.3, the Foundation, trademark owner, and distributors disclaim liability for damages and provide works “AS-IS,” without warranties of merchantability or fitness (1.F.4). Some jurisdictions limit disclaimers; invalid parts are to be construed to the maximum extent permitted without voiding the remainder (1.F.5). Section 1.F.6 adds an indemnity: users agree to hold harmless the Foundation, trademark owner, agents, employees, distributors, and volunteers from liability, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from the user’s actions, including distribution, modification, or defects. Sections 2–5 supply mission and organizational context: Project Gutenberg promotes free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by a broad range of computers; volunteer labor and financial support sustain the effort. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit; EIN 64-6221541) manages trademark licensing and fundraising; the website www.gutenberg.org provides contact links, donation methods, search facilities, and participation avenues. Donations of many sizes help maintain free access and legal compliance across states; international donations are accepted though tax treatment varies. Together these terms and structures enable mostly free public access while defining obligations for those who redistribute materials under the Project Gutenberg name, much as the novel’s communities rely on shared codes—propriety, thrift, and mutual duty—to sustain social life even amid private passions and losses.
