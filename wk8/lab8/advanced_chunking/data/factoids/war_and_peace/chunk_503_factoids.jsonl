{"chunk_id": 503, "factoid": "The feeling was a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something."}
{"chunk_id": 503, "factoid": "Pierre experienced a glad consciousness that everything constituting men's happiness—comforts of life, wealth, even life itself—is rubbish and pleasant to throw away compared with something."}
