{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya felt that he no longer looked presentable."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya feared that if he approached the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the Emperor."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "It was impossible for Pétya to smarten himself up or move to another place because of the crowd."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "One of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostóvs."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya thought of asking that general for help."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya concluded that asking that general would not be a manly thing to do."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd carrying Pétya streamed forward into the Krémlin Square."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The Krémlin Square was already full of people."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "People were present in the square, on the slopes, and on the roofs."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "As soon as Pétya found himself in the square he heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Krémlin."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "For a while the crowd was less dense."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Suddenly all heads were bared and everyone rushed forward in one direction."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Everybody shouted \"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see nothing except the people around him."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "A tradesman’s wife stood beside Pétya and sobbed."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The tears ran down her cheeks."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "She repeated \"Father! Angel! Dear one!\" and wiped away her tears with her fingers."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "\"Hurrah!\" was heard on all sides."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush forward."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya, beside himself, clinched his teeth and rolled his eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowed his way, and shouted \"hurrah!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya was prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "On both sides of Pétya other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted \"hurrah!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya thought \"So this is what the Emperor is!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya thought \"No, I can’t petition him myself—that would be too bold.\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya continued to struggle desperately forward."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "From between the backs of those in front Pétya caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The crowd swayed back because the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya unexpectedly received a blow on his side and ribs."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya was squeezed so hard that everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "When Pétya came to himself, a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The clerical clerk said \"You’ve crushed the young gentleman!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The clerical clerk said \"What are you up to? Gently!... They’ve crushed him, crushed him!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The crowd spread out again more evenly."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "The clerical clerk led Pétya, pale and breathless, to the Tsar-cannon."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Several people were sorry for Pétya."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "A crowd turned toward Pétya and pressed round him."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Those who stood nearest Pétya attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others who might be crushed him."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Voices said \"One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing people! Poor dear, he’s as white as a sheet!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, and the pain had passed."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "At the cost of that temporary unpleasantness Pétya obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be returning that way."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "Pétya no longer thought of presenting his petition."}
{"chunk_id": 449, "factoid": "If Pétya could only see the Emperor he would be happy."}
