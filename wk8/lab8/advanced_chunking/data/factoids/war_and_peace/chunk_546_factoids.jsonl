{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "The problem seemed insoluble to the ancients."}
{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "The absurd answer that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from the arbitrary division of motion into discontinuous elements."}

{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion, we only approach a solution of the problem."}
{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "We never reach a complete solution of the problem by adopting smaller elements."}
{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "Only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small do we reach a solution of the problem."}

{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "It conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity)."}
{"chunk_id": 546, "factoid": "It corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion."}
