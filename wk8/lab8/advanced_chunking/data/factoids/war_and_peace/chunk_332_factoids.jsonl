{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The whippers-in changed to the cry of ulyulyu."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel’s voice rose, sometimes deep bass, sometimes piercingly shrill."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel’s voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far into the open field."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The Count and his attendant listened in silence for a few moments."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The Count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The larger pack’s sound began to die away in the distance."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The other pack rushed by the wood past the Count."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel’s voice was heard calling ulyulyu as the packs moved."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again."}

{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The sound of the hunt suddenly approached."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The hounds were in full cry and Daniel was ulyulyuing."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The Count turned and saw on his right Mítka staring at him."}

{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Mítka shouted \"Look out!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Mítka let the borzois slip and galloped toward the Count."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The Count and Simon galloped out of the wood."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "They saw on their left a wolf that was softly swaying from side to side."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The angry borzois whined."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The borzois got free of the leash and rushed past the horses' feet at the wolf."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf paused."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf was still slightly swaying from side to side."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf gave a couple of leaps."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf swished its tail and disappeared into the skirt of the wood."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "At the same instant, first one hound then another then another sprang from the wood opposite."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The whole pack rushed across the field toward the spot where the wolf had disappeared."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Hazel bushes part behind the hounds."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel’s chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel sat on the long back of the horse."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel was hunched forward, capless."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel had disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel cried \"Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...\"."}

{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel shouted \"Blast you!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel held up his whip threateningly at the Count."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel said \"You've let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!\"."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the Count had aroused."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Daniel flew off after the hounds."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The Count looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon’s sympathy for his plight."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Simon was no longer there."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "Simon was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "All were trying to head the wolf."}
{"chunk_id": 332, "factoid": "The wolf vanished into the wood before they could do so."}
