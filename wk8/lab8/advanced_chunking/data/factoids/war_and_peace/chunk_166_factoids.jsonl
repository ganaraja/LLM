{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said that now Kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said everything is now centered round the Emperor."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said they will go to Dolgorúkov."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said he has to go to Dolgorúkov anyhow."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said he has already spoken to Prince Dolgorúkov about the other person."}

{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting before advancing had been completely silenced."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Their arguments were confuted by conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "The discussion at the council about the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "All the advantages were on our side."}
{"chunk_id": 166, "factoid": "Our enormous forces were undoubtedly superior to Napoleon’s."}
