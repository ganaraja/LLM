{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Kutúzov rode toward a nearby sound of artillery fire."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew tried to keep near Kutúzov."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew saw Frenchmen running toward the Russian battery."}

{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew was scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew only ran a few steps alone."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "One soldier moved and then another."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The whole battalion ran forward shouting 'Hurrah!' and overtook Prince Andrew."}

{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Soldiers to the right and left of Prince Andrew continually groaned and dropped."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew did not look at those soldiers."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew looked only at what was going on in front of him—at the battery."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The red-haired gunner had his shako knocked awry."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The red-haired gunner was pulling one end of a mop."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "A French soldier tugged at the other end of the mop."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of the red-haired gunner and the French soldier."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The two men evidently did not realize what they were doing."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew thought 'What are they about?' as he gazed at them."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew wondered why the red-haired gunner did not run away as he was unarmed."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew wondered why the Frenchman did not stab the gunner."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew thought the Frenchman would not get away before remembering his bayonet and stabbing him."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "Prince Andrew did not see how it ended."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "It seemed to Prince Andrew as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The hit hurt a little."}
{"chunk_id": 187, "factoid": "The worst part was that the pain distracted Prince Andrew and prevented him from seeing what he had been looking at."}
