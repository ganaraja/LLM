{"chunk_id": 212, "factoid": "The countess said, \"What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.\"."}
{"chunk_id": 212, "factoid": "The countess raised her voice and became more and more excited."}
{"chunk_id": 212, "factoid": "The countess said, \"A man who’s a better man than you in every way...\"."}
{"chunk_id": 212, "factoid": "Pierre growled, \"Hm... Hm...!\" and frowning without looking at the countess."}
{"chunk_id": 212, "factoid": "The countess said, \"And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.\"."}
