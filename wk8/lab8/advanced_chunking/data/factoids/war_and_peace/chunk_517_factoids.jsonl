{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side lost the battle at Austerlitz."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "The French army's losses were almost equal to our army's losses."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side said to itself early that it was losing the battle."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side lost the battle."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side said so because it had nothing to fight for there."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as possible."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side said “We’ve lost, so let us run,” and it ran."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "If our side had not said that until the evening, something might not have happened."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Tomorrow our side will not say it."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Our side talks about its position: the left flank is weak and the right flank is too extended."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "That is nonsense; there is nothing of that kind."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "What awaits our side tomorrow?"}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "There are a hundred million most diverse chances that will be decided instantly by whether our army’s men or the enemy army’s men run or do not run."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Whether this man or that man is killed also matters."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "All that is being done at present is only play."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those men with whom you have ridden round the position do not help matters but hinder."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those men are only concerned with their own petty interests."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Pierre reproached at such a moment."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Prince Andrew repeated at such a moment."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "To them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "For Prince Andrew tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "The side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make, our side shall win tomorrow’s battle."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Tomorrow, happen what may, our side shall win."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "That is the truth, the real truth, said Timókhin."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Who would spare himself now?"}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "The soldiers in Timókhin’s battalion would not drink their vodka."}

{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "The officers rose."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Prince Andrew went out of the shed with the officers, giving final orders to the adjutant."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "After they had gone, Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "They heard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far from the shed."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "They rode close by continuing to converse."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these words: “The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently commend that view.”"}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Clausewitz said: “The only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of course one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals.”"}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "The other agreed “Oh, no.”"}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Prince Andrew said “Extend widely!” with an angry snort when they had ridden past."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "In that “extend” were Prince Andrew’s father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "That is all the same to Prince Andrew."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those German gentlemen will not win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those German gentlemen have nothing in their heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those German gentlemen haven’t in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow: that which Timókhin has."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those German gentlemen have yielded up all Europe to Timókhin."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Those German gentlemen have now come to teach us."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Fine teachers."}
{"chunk_id": 517, "factoid": "Pierre asked: “So you think our side shall win tomorrow’s battle?”"}
