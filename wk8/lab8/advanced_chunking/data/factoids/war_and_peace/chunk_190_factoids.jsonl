{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Borís thought Rostóv had addressed the Grand Duke as 'His Highness'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "The Grand Duke stood a hundred paces away from them, wearing a helmet and a Horse Guards jacket, and shouted something to a pale white uniformed Austrian officer."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv said that the person he saw was the Grand Duke."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv said he wanted the commander in chief or the Emperor."}

{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv passed the Guards and traversed an empty space."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv avoided getting in front of the first line again, as he had done when the Horse Guards charged."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv followed the line of reserves."}

{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "The foreboding increased as Rostóv rode into the region behind the village of Pratzen."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "The region behind the village of Pratzen was full of troops of all kinds."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv kept asking 'What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv approached Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "A crowd of fugitives told Rostóv in Russian, German, and Czech: 'The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all up now!'."}

{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one another."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv thought 'My God! What does it all mean?'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv thought 'And here, where at any moment the Emperor may see them... But no, these must be only a handful of scoundrels.'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv thought 'It will soon be over.'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv thought 'It can't be that, it can't be!'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv thought 'Only to get past them quicker, quicker!'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv could not think of defeat and flight."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights."}

{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "The whole mass droned and jostled in confusion."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Cannon balls were flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv kept asking 'Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutúzov?'."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv got no answer from anyone."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv seized a soldier by his collar."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "Rostóv forced the soldier to answer."}
{"chunk_id": 190, "factoid": "The soldier said 'Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!'."}
