{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv mentally exclaimed, 'Go on! Go on! Give it them!' at the sounds."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther into the region where the army was already in action."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv thought, 'How it will be there I don’t know, but all will be well!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "After passing some Austrian troops, Rostóv noticed that the next part of the line, the Guards, was already in action."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv thought, 'So much the better! I shall see it close.'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv was riding almost along the front line."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "A handful of men came galloping toward Rostóv."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Those men were our Uhlans."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Uhlans had disordered ranks and were returning from the attack."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv got out of the way of the Uhlans."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv involuntarily noticed that one of the Uhlans was bleeding."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv galloped on after the Uhlans."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv thought, 'That is no business of mine.'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw, to his left across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward Rostóv and across his path."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of the cavalry."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv would have gotten clear had the cavalry continued at the same speed."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The cavalry kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv heard the thud of the cavalry's hoofs and the jingle of their weapons."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv saw the cavalry's horses, figures, and faces more and more distinctly."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Those men were our Horse Guards."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Horse Guards were advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Horse Guards were galloping but still holding in their horses."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv could already see the Horse Guards' faces and heard the command 'Charge!' shouted by an officer urging his thoroughbred to full speed."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv feared being crushed or swept into the attack on the French."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv galloped along the front as hard as Rostóv's horse could go."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv was still not in time to avoid the Horse Guards."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The last of the Horse Guards was a huge pockmarked fellow."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The pockmarked fellow frowned angrily upon seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to the gigantic men and horses."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv flourished his whip before the Guardsman's horse."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Horse Guards passed Rostóv."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv heard the Horse Guards shout, 'Hurrah!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv looked back and saw that the Horse Guards' foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The Horse Guards, having passed Rostóv, disappeared in the smoke."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after the Horse Guards or to go where he was sent."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The charge of the Horse Guards amazed the French themselves."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv thought, 'Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see the Emperor immediately!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv galloped on."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "When Rostóv came level with the Foot Guards, he noticed that cannon balls were flying around them."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv was aware of the cannon balls because Rostóv heard their sound and saw uneasiness on the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on the officers."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv passed behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv heard a voice calling him by name."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "The voice was from Borís."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís said, 'Rostóv!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv answered, 'What?' not recognizing Borís."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís said, 'We’ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís had a happy smile on his face."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv stopped."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv asked, 'Have you?' 'Well, how did it go?'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís said, 'We drove them back!'"}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís was animated and talkative."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Borís described how the Guards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action."}
{"chunk_id": 189, "factoid": "Rostóv spurred his horse without hearing Borís to the end."}
