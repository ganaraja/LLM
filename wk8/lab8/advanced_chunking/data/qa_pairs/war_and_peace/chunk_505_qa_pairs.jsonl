{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "Why did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodinó until August 25, 1812?", "answer": "They did not anticipate a battle there; no entrenchments existed until August 25, and the works begun on the 25th and 26th were incomplete."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "What evidence shows that the Russians did not expect a battle at Borodinó?", "answer": "The absence of fortifications until August 25, the unfinished works on the 25th and 26th, and the misinterpretation of the Shevárdino Redoubt as an advanced post all indicate that the battle was not foreseen."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "Why was the Shevárdino Redoubt heavily fortified compared to other posts?", "answer": "Commanders believed it was the left flank of the intended position and treated it as an advanced post, so they invested heavily in its fortification."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "How did Napoleon’s movement affect the Russian position at Borodinó?", "answer": "Napoleon crossed the Kolochá, moved the Russian left flank, and forced the Russians to abandon their intended position and take a new, unfortified spot."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "Where was the original Russian position intended relative to the river Kolochá?", "answer": "It was along the Kolochá where it crossed the highroad at an acute angle, with the left flank at Shevárdino, the right flank near Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "What terrain did the battle of August 26 actually take place on?", "answer": "It took place on the plain between Utítsa, Semënovsk, and Borodinó, a plain that was no more advantageous than any other Russian plain."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "Why did Barclay de Tolly and Bagratión think the Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank?", "answer": "Before August 25 they were convinced of this arrangement, and Kutúzov’s hurried report after the battle also referred to the redoubt as the left flank."}
{"chunk_id": 505, "question": "How did the post at Borodinó differ from the intended fortified position?", "answer": "The battle was fought on an almost unentrenched, unexpected spot rather than on the pre‑selected, fortified position."}
