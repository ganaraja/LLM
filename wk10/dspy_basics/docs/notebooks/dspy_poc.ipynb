    "## Motivation: Why Do We Need DSPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama are powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. However, achieving high-quality results often requires extensive prompt engineering, chaining multiple prompts, and retrieving relevant information—all of which can be difficult to optimize manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Traditional LLM Development Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches to building AI applications with language models face several critical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Prompt Engineering Overhead**\n",
    "- Crafting effective prompts requires extensive trial and error\n",
    "- Each task requires custom prompt design and optimization\n",
    "- Manual prompt tuning doesn't scale to complex applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Model Brittleness**\n",
    "- A prompt that works well on one model may fail on another\n",
    "- Performance degrades when switching between different model versions\n",
    "- No systematic way to adapt prompts across model families\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scaling Complexity**\n",
    "- As tasks become more complex, manually composing reasoning steps becomes unmanageable\n",
    "- Multi-step reasoning requires careful orchestration of multiple LLM calls\n",
    "- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems need sophisticated prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Lack of Systematic Optimization**\n",
    "- No principled way to improve prompts based on feedback\n",
    "- Manual optimization doesn't leverage the full potential of modern LLMs\n",
    "- Difficult to maintain and iterate on complex AI systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DSPy Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "[DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) (Declarative Self-Improving Python) addresses these challenges by providing a **declarative framework for building modular AI software**. Instead of wrangling prompts or training jobs, DSPy enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build AI software from natural-language modules** and compose them generically\n",
    "- **Compile AI programs into effective prompts and weights** for your language models\n",
    "- **Iterate fast on structured code** rather than brittle strings\n",
    "- **Make AI software more reliable, maintainable, and portable** across models and strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of DSPy as a **higher-level language for AI programming**—like the shift from assembly to C or pointer arithmetic to SQL. It abstracts away the complexity of prompt engineering and provides systematic optimization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DSPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy is a **declarative framework for building modular AI software** that allows you to **iterate fast on structured code**, rather than brittle strings, and offers algorithms that **compile AI programs into effective prompts and weights** for your language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of wrangling prompts or training jobs, DSPy enables you to **build AI software from natural-language modules** and to _generically compose them_ with different models, inference strategies, or learning algorithms. This makes AI software **more reliable, maintainable, and portable** across models and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Modules** - Help you describe AI behavior as code, not strings\n",
    "- Define structured interfaces for AI tasks\n",
    "- Compose complex reasoning pipelines\n",
    "- Work across different models and strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Optimizers** - Tune the prompts and weights of your AI modules\n",
    "- Systematic algorithms for improving performance\n",
    "- Learn from examples and feedback\n",
    "- Compose different optimization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Ecosystem** - Advances open-source AI research\n",
    "- Large community contributing modules and optimizers\n",
    "- Distributed improvement of compositional architectures\n",
    "- Faster iteration and better programs over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Models\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy works with a wide range of language models:\n",
    "- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo\n",
    "- **Anthropic**: Claude-3-opus, Claude-3-sonnet, Claude-3-haiku\n",
    "- **Google**: Gemini-2.5-flash, Gemini-1.5-pro\n",
    "- **Databricks**: Databricks-llama-4-maverick\n",
    "- **Local Models**: Llama, Mistral, and other open-source models\n",
    "- **Other Providers**: Via LiteLLM integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## How DSPy Works\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy follows a systematic approach to building and optimizing AI programs. Here's how the framework operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Signatures (Task Descriptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing direct prompts, DSPy uses **signatures** to define what your AI program should do. Signatures specify the inputs and outputs in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Question Answering Task**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dspy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the signature for answering questions from context\n",
    "class AnswerQuestion(dspy.Signature):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Answer a question based on the given context.\"\"\"\n",
    "    context: str = dspy.InputField()\n",
    "    question: str = dspy.InputField()\n",
    "    answer: str = dspy.OutputField()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This signature tells DSPy:\n",
    "- **Inputs**: `context` (the source material) and `question` (what to answer)\n",
    "- **Output**: `answer` (the response we want to optimize)\n",
    "- **Task**: Answer questions based on provided context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create Modules (AI Components)\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy modules are the building blocks that implement your signatures. They handle the actual LLM interactions and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Configure your language model\n",
    "lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')\n",
    "dspy.configure(lm=lm)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a module that uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning\n",
    "predictor = dspy.ChainOfThought(AnswerQuestion)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the module\n",
    "response = predictor(\n",
    "    context=\"Quantum mechanics explains the behavior of particles at a subatomic level.\",\n",
    "    question=\"What is quantum mechanics?\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "print(response.answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- DSPy automatically determines the best prompting strategy\n",
    "- No manual prompt engineering required\n",
    "- Works consistently across different models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Optimization with Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy's power comes from its optimization algorithms that learn from examples to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Prepare training examples\n",
    "examples = [\n",
    "    AnswerQuestion(\n",
    "        context=\"Photosynthesis converts sunlight into energy.\",\n",
    "        question=\"What is photosynthesis?\",\n",
    "        answer=\"A process where plants convert sunlight into energy.\"\n",
    "    ),\n",
    "    AnswerQuestion(\n",
    "        context=\"Gravity is a force that attracts objects toward each other.\",\n",
    "        question=\"What is gravity?\",\n",
    "        answer=\"A force that pulls objects toward one another.\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimize using MIPROv2 (a powerful DSPy optimizer)\n",
    "optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2()\n",
    "optimized_predictor = optimizer.compile(predictor, trainset=examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The optimized predictor now performs better\n",
    "response = optimized_predictor(\n",
    "    context=\"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.\",\n",
    "    question=\"What is machine learning?\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Optimization Works\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy optimizers like MIPROv2 follow a sophisticated process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrapping**: Run your program on various inputs to collect traces of input/output behavior\n",
    "2. **Grounded Proposals**: Use your program's code, data, and traces to draft potential instructions\n",
    "3. **Discrete Search**: Sample mini-batches, propose instruction combinations, and evaluate performance\n",
    "4. **Surrogate Learning**: Update models to improve proposals over time\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a program that automatically learns better prompting strategies and reasoning patterns from your examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using DSPy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Eliminates Manual Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Approach:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manual prompt crafting - brittle and time-consuming\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "Given the following context: {context}\n",
    "Answer this question: {question}\n",
    "Please provide a clear and accurate answer.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy Approach:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Declarative signature - DSPy handles the prompting\n",
    "class AnswerQuestion(dspy.Signature):\n",
    "    context: str = dspy.InputField()\n",
    "    question: str = dspy.InputField()\n",
    "    answer: str = dspy.OutputField()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy automatically optimizes prompts based on your data and performance metrics, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Portability\n",
    "\n",
    "The same DSPy program works seamlessly across different language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Works with OpenAI\n",
    "lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')\n",
    "dspy.configure(lm=lm)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Switch to Anthropic - no code changes needed\n",
    "lm = dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-3-sonnet')\n",
    "dspy.configure(lm=lm)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Switch to local model - still works\n",
    "lm = dspy.LM('ollama/llama3')\n",
    "dspy.configure(lm=lm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Systematic Optimization\n",

    "- **BetterTogether**: Compose multiple optimization strategies\n",
    "- **Ensemble**: Combine multiple optimized programs for better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Advanced RAG Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy excels at building sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Multi-hop RAG with automatic reasoning\n",
    "class MultiHopRAG(dspy.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=3)\n",
    "        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> answer\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, question):\n",
    "        # DSPy learns optimal retrieval and reasoning strategies\n",
    "        passages = self.retrieve(question)\n",
    "        return self.generate_answer(context=passages, question=question)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Composable and Maintainable\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy programs are modular and composable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Build complex AI systems by composing simple modules\n",
    "class ResearchAgent(dspy.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.search = SearchModule()\n",
    "        self.summarize = SummarizeModule()\n",
    "        self.analyze = AnalyzeModule()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, query):\n",
    "        results = self.search(query)\n",
    "        summary = self.summarize(results)\n",
    "        analysis = self.analyze(summary)\n",
    "        return analysis\n",

    "- **`dspy.InputField()`**: Defines the input parameter `topic` that the language model will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`dspy.OutputField()`**: Defines the expected outputs:\n",
    "  - `title`: The main title of the article\n",

    "  3. Returns a `dspy.Prediction` object containing the final article\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key DSPy Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: The code breaks down article generation into smaller, reusable components (outline generation and section drafting).\n",

    "2. **Composability**: The `DraftArticle` module combines two other modules (`build_outline` and `draft_section`) to create a more complex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Declarative Programming**: Instead of writing prompts manually, you declare what inputs and outputs you want, and DSPy handles the prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Chain of Thought**: The `ChainOfThought` wrapper encourages the language model to reason through the task step-by-step, which typically improves output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final line `article = draft_article(topic=\"Quantum Chromodynamics\")` demonstrates how to use the module - simply call it with a topic and it will generate a complete article with title, sections, and content."

       "### What is QCD?\n",
       "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the quantum field theory that describes the interactions between quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of matter. QCD is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity, and it employs the concept of color charge, which is analogous to electric charge in electromagnetism but has three types—commonly referred to as red, green, and blue. The core idea of QCD is that these color charges interact through the exchange of gluons, the force carriers that mediate the strong force. This interaction is responsible for binding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other baryons, as well as binding gluons together in a unique way that leads to confinement.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Historical Context\n",
       "The development of QCD was a significant milestone in the history of particle physics, emerging in the late 20th century as part of the broader framework known as the Standard Model. Its roots can be traced back to the observations of deep inelastic scattering experiments in the 1960s, which revealed that protons and neutrons were not elementary particles but were composed of smaller constituents called quarks. The formulation of QCD began to take shape in the early 1970s, culminating in the development of the theory by David Gross, Frank Wilczek, and H. David Politzer, who were later awarded the Nobel Prize for their contributions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Significance in Particle Physics\n",
       "QCD plays a pivotal role in our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature. As one of the four fundamental interactions—alongside electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and gravity—QCD is essential for explaining phenomena such as the mass of protons and neutrons, the stability of atomic nuclei, and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as in neutron stars or during the early moments of the universe. Furthermore, ongoing research in QCD helps to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations at high-energy particle colliders, enhancing our understanding of the strong force and its implications for the universe’s structure."

       "At the core of Quantum Chromodynamics are two types of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons. Quarks are the building blocks of hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, and come in six varieties, referred to as \"flavors\": up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Gluons, on the other hand, are the force carriers for the strong interaction, analogous to how photons mediate electromagnetic forces. They are unique in that they also possess color charge, allowing them to interact with each other in addition to quarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Color Charge\n",
       "Color charge is a property of quarks and gluons that is central to the strong force. Unlike electric charge, color charge comes in three types, designated as red, green, and blue, with corresponding anticolor charges. Quarks always combine in such a way that they form color-neutral particles, a requirement known as color confinement. This results in the observable fact that free quarks are never found in isolation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Confinement and Asymptotic Freedom\n",
       "Confinement is the phenomenon whereby quarks and gluons are perpetually confined within hadrons, preventing the isolation of individual quarks. Asymptotic freedom, conversely, describes the behavior of quarks and gluons at extremely short distances; at these scales, they interact weakly, allowing them to behave almost as free particles. This dual behavior is key to understanding the complexities of strong interactions and is a fundamental aspect of QCD."

       "## Mathematical Framework of QCD\n",
       "\n",
       "### Lagrangian Formalism\n",
       "At the heart of Quantum Chromodynamics is its Lagrangian, which encapsulates the dynamics of quarks and gluons through a non-Abelian gauge theory. The QCD Lagrangian can be expressed as follows:\n",
       "\n",
       "$\n",
       "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = \\sum_{q} \\bar{\\psi}_q(i\\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m_q)\\psi_q - \\frac{1}{4}G^{\\mu\\nu}_aG_{\\mu\\nu}^a\n",
       "$\n",
       "\n",
       "Here, $\\psi_q$ represents the quark fields, $m_q$ is the quark mass, $D_\\mu$ is the covariant derivative that accounts for the interaction with the gluon fields, and $G^{\\mu\\nu}_a$ is the gluon field strength tensor. This form encapsulates the interaction between quarks, mediated by gluons, and reflects the fundamental symmetry properties intrinsic to the color charge of particles.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Feynman Diagrams\n",
       "Feynman diagrams serve as a powerful visual tool for calculating particle interactions in QCD. Each line and vertex in the diagram represents specific particles and their interactions, enabling physicists to systematically compute scattering amplitudes. The basic elements include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Quark lines, depicted as solid lines.\n",
       "- Gluon lines, represented by wavy or curly lines, indicating the exchange of force carriers.\n",
       "- Interaction vertices, where lines meet, corresponding to fundamental QCD interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "These diagrams facilitate not just comprehension of complex processes such as jet production in high-energy collisions, but also provide a framework for perturbative calculations essential in predicting outcomes of particle interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Renormalization\n",
       "Given that QCD is a quantum field theory, it exhibits divergences that require careful treatment through renormalization. The process involves redefining mass and charge parameters to absorb infinities arising in loop calculations. Renormalization ensures that physical predictions remain finite and measurable. In QCD, various renormalization schemes, such as the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ (modified minimal subtraction), are employed to facilitate perturbative calculations, particularly at small coupling constants where the theory is most reliable. This crucial aspect of the mathematical framework allows for precise predictions that align with experimental results."

       "## Experimental Evidence and Discoveries\n",
       "\n",
       "### Deep Inelastic Scattering\n",
       "Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) is one of the pivotal experiments that provided direct evidence for the existence of quarks within protons and neutrons. Conducted at high-energy particle colliders, DIS involves bombarding a proton with a high-energy electron. The resulting scattering events reveal information about the internal structure of the proton, indicating that it is not a simple particle, but rather a collection of quarks and gluons. Measurements from these experiments have confirmed the predictions of QCD regarding the distribution of quarks and have supported the concept that these particles engage in strong interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Jet Production\n",
       "Jet production is another crucial piece of evidence for QCD, observed in high-energy collisions where quarks and gluons are produced. When a high-energy collision occurs, quarks are freed from their confinement and emit radiation, resulting in the formation of collimated streams of particles known as jets. The characteristics of these jets—such as their distribution and multiplicity—are consistent with QCD predictions, providing further validation for the theory. The studies of jet production at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shown that the behavior of jets complies with the underlying principles of QCD, helping physicists to understand the dynamics of strong interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Lattice QCD\n",
       "Lattice QCD is a computational approach that allows physicists to study QCD in a non-perturbative regime by discretizing space-time into a lattice. This method enables simulations of quark and gluon interactions, offering insights into phenomena that are difficult to observe experimentally. Recent advancements in lattice QCD have yielded critical insights into binding energies, mass calculations of hadrons, and the nature of the QCD phase transition. By comparing lattice calculations with experimental results, researchers have been able to refine their understanding of the strong force and its implications for particle physics."

       "## Implications of QCD in Modern Physics\n",
       "\n",
       "### QCD and the Standard Model\n",
       "Quantum Chromodynamics is crucial for the Standard Model of particle physics, which unifies the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. It describes how quarks and gluons interact through the exchange of color charge, providing insights into the asymptotic freedom of quarks at high energies. This has been pivotal in explaining phenomena observed in high-energy particle collisions, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The predictions made by QCD have been confirmed through various experimental results, including the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Role in Cosmology\n",
       "In cosmology, QCD plays a vital role in understanding the early universe's development. During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was in a state of extremely high temperature and density, where quarks and gluons existed freely in what is known as the quark-gluon plasma. The dynamics of QCD are essential to explain the transition from this state to the formation of protons and neutrons, leading to the baryogenesis process and the subsequent formation of atomic nuclei. Understanding QCD thus helps to elucidate the conditions that led to the cosmic structure we observe today.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Future Directions\n",
       "The future of research in Quantum Chromodynamics is rich with possibilities. There are ongoing efforts to refine our understanding of confinement—a phenomenon where quarks are never found in isolation. Advances in lattice QCD, a non-perturbative approach to solve QCD on a discretized space-time lattice, aim to provide clearer predictions and a deeper understanding of the strong force. Furthermore, studying QCD in the context of high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions can reveal more about matter under extreme conditions and potentially unlock answers to unsolved questions in the universe's evolution."

      "The Ramanujan-Hardy number, also known as the \"taxicab number,\" is 1729. It became famous due to a story involving the mathematicians Srinivasa Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy. Hardy visited Ramanujan in the hospital and mentioned that he arrived in a taxi with the uninteresting number 1729. Ramanujan immediately responded that 1729 was, in fact, very interesting because it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: \\(1^3 + 12^3\\) and \\(9^3 + 10^3\\). This anecdote highlights Ramanujan's extraordinary intuition for numbers and has made 1729 a notable figure in number theory.\n",

The total number of ways to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard is given by the number of placements of 8 queens without any restrictions. This is equivalent to choosing 8 out of 64 squares, where the order doesn't matter, which is calculated as combinations.

    "# DSPy Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "A DSPy optimizer is an algorithm that can tune the parameters of a DSPy program (i.e., the prompts and/or the LM weights) to maximize the metrics you specify, like accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical DSPy optimizer takes three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your DSPy program.  This may be a single module (e.g., dspy.Predict) or a complex multi-module program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your metric. This is a function that evaluates the output of your program, and assigns it a score (higher is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A few training inputs. This may be very small (i.e., only 5 or 10 examples) and incomplete (only inputs to your program, without any labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does a DSPy Optimizer tune? How does it tune them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different optimizers in DSPy will tune your program's quality by synthesizing good few-shot examples for every module, like dspy.BootstrapRS, proposing and intelligently exploring better natural-language instructions for every prompt, like dspy.MIPROv2, and dspy.GEPA, and building datasets for your modules and using them to finetune the LM weights in your system, like dspy.BootstrapFinetune.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which optimizer should I use?\n",
    "Ultimately, finding the ‘right’ optimizer to use & the best configuration for your task will require experimentation. Success in DSPy is still an iterative process - getting the best performance on your task will require you to explore and iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, here's the general guidance on getting started:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have very few examples (around 10), start with BootstrapFewShot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have more data (50 examples or more), try BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you prefer to do instruction optimization only (i.e. you want to keep your prompt 0-shot), use MIPROv2 configured for 0-shot optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you’re willing to use more inference calls to perform longer optimization runs (e.g. 40 trials or more), and have enough data (e.g. 200 examples or more to prevent overfitting) then try MIPROv2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have been able to use one of these with a large LM (e.g., 7B parameters or above) and need a very efficient program, finetune a small LM for your task with BootstrapFinetune.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic Finetuning\n",
    "This optimizer is used to fine-tune the underlying LLM(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "BootstrapFinetune: Distills a prompt-based DSPy program into weight updates. The output is a DSPy program that has the same steps, but where each step is conducted by a finetuned model instead of a prompted LM. See the classification fine-tuning tutorial for a complete example."
