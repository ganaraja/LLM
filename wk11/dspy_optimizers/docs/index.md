# Introduction

In this project, we show how one can use DSPy for many of the common interactions with an LM without having to tinker with prompts, and instead follow a structured approach to defining DSPy modules that help describe the required AI behavior as code, rather than strings.

We also show an example where we can fine-tune the original DSPy module with a training dataset to achieve improved results.
